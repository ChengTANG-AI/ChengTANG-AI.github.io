I am an Research Assistant Professor in the **Artificial Intelligence** at [Nagoya Institute of Technology](https://www.nitech.ac.jp/). 
I conduct my research in the **[Hirata & Kodera Lab](https://cem.web.nitech.ac.jp/hilab/)** advised by **[Prof. Hirata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zSV81YwAAAAJ)**.
I received a Ph.D. degree in engineering from the University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan, in 2022.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Machine / Deep Learning**, **Computational Neuroscience**, **Neural Networks**, **Evolutionary Computation**, and **Bioinformatics**.

The research projects that I worked on, or am actively working on include: 
* **Representation learning**: Developing self-supervised learning and generative learning methods to obtain robust representation of neural data without relying on explicit human annotation.
* **Interpretable deep learning methods**: Building deep learning architectures that are interpretable and identifiable under certain pre-defined conditions or assumptions.
* **Image segmentation**: Efficient methods for image segmentation with limited or noisy annotations, explicit constraints, or topological/geometrical priors.

Outside from research, I do indoor climbing and I have two catsüê±.

**I am looking for 2 MS/Undergrad students to advise and collaborate with on a neuroimage-related project and a neural recording project. If you are a current Georgia Tech MS/Undergrad student and interested in this research area, feel free to send me an email.**
